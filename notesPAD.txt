- skewness before and after log (before better -> less skewed)
- confidence intervals and so on based on the data after 
applying log function correct? (without log)
- natural log of both variables? at once or separately?
in tutorial only on y (just try it)
- is it possible that p-value is 0 in our case? (almost probably)
- is the confidence interval correct? (yup)
- what about the other conficence intervals, suggestions? (without h)

------------------------------------------------------------
-  Make a comment whether one of the normalizations
is better and why -> the shape the same but scale different, is it ok?
which one is better (tip)? -> with bar plot for the explanation  of variance
-  data points representing a pre-specified, by yourself, group of
objects. Comment on the choice of your groups -> how should we do it?
DO A CLASS ATRRIBUTE OUT OF 1 FEATURE (round)
- Compute and interpret one hidden factor behind the selected features. The factor should be expressed in a 0-100
rank scale as well as the features???? on presentation PCA&SVM_ModuleIPAD1819.pdf slajd 56
- do we have to do also centralization? yes

- how to visualize data with more than 2/3 dimesions? we don't have to do more
- how can we know the c_max value we don't know xD
- what is the best number of centers Xie-Beni index (it is in python!) compare fuzzy with anomalous initializaition 

measure the quality of the projection
how? -> look at the foto
